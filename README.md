# Mixed-Signal-STM32-Dev-Board

This project follows the  [Mixed-Signal Hardware Design with KiCad](https://fedevel.com/courses/mixed-signal-hardware-design-with-kicad) 4-layer PCB design course instructed by Philip Salmony of the Phil's Lab youtube channel.  

## System Level Description
  ## Basic Requirements
    - USB powered, single channel, low frequency analysis and generation capabilities
    - Perform frequency analysis, arbitrary signal generation
  ## Feature specific requirements
    - USB - <500mA current consumption 
    - Low Frequency - 20Hz - 20kHz (audio band)
    - ADC and DAC (or codec) for analysis and generation, single channel
